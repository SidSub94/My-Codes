# Hi there!

This simple Python and Dash based application will stream Twitter live, and give you a live graph of average sentiment values of tweets in a localhost server.

I would like to thank Author - SentDex and his page https://pythonprogramming.net/ for giving tutorials on such applications.

I have modified the code to fit the latest update of Dash, as 21-10-2019 which Dash 1.4.1.

# Thank you and have fun!
