# Welcome to Sid's GitHub

Hi Everyone!

Below are some of the codes you will find in my GitHub, and I am new to GitHub, so do let me know if there are any mistakes, or improvements to be done, to my pages.

## Project #1 - Object Identification

In the 'Object-Identification' repository, I have added the pre-requisites required to perform object identifcation and have attached my Python codes for each step of the process.

The documentation with instructions of how to do the project is in the repo.


## Project #2 - Twitter API access to download tweets using Hashtags

I have attached a jupyter notebook code, with all the code you will need to download tweets from the official Twitter API.

The instructions and details are in the repo.

## Thank you for reading!
